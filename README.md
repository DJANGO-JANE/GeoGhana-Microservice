GeoGhana is a WebAPI implementation of a postcode system for Ghana. Using three(3) entities to reach your area!
It creates an 8-character postcode, one character is a whitespace.


## Features

- Get details about Regions, Cities and Localities. Eg. How many cities/localities in a particular Region.
- Search for areas by postcode or name.


## Contributions
GeoGhana API is still being seeded with data about localities in Ghana(there are numerous).
Contribute by using the appropriate endpoint to add localities near you! 

Note:
# Regions
> Each Region can only assign a two(2)-character Region Code
> The application adds an extra character (X) to help denote Regions in the postcode


# Localities
> Refrain from adding smaller towns/areas;
> instead, add larger urban areas.
> Eg. Add Dansoman, not a smaller area in Dansoman.
> Eg. Teshie is a locality, not Lascala.
